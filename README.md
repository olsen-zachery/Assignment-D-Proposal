# Assignment-D-Proposal

//Music Visualisation

//For assignment D, I plan to create a video based on the idea of Music Visualisation. Music Visualisation is a type of visual coding that takes cues from an audio file (e.g. frequency, amplitude) and uses them to affect the patch to trigger visualisations in the patch.

//For me, there are 2 reasons that attracts me to this style of video processing. 

//Firstly, it is very reactive to the song it is using for the process. This will make it glue very closely to the song I will use and I like the reactive style of this type of coding.

//Secondly, it is a flexible patch that will allow me to use it for other songs at my disposal, as the visualisation of the patch will follow the cues of any other song.

//I have found a Music Visualiser code online that I was able to get working. (URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHpxRv4MBBA)
//Was able to change the song that the visualiser takes it cues from. For now, I will be decoding it so that I can use the skeletal fundamentals of it to make my own.

//The intended outcome for my Assignment D will be alike the source I found. I would like the Video to be "moving forward", as I like the feel it has. I intend to use frequency and volume to affect my video with respect to object size, shape, colour & movement. I will likely use a simple shape, such as squares, circles & lines as my primary objects.
